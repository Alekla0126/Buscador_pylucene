      "content": "Most innovations in the automotive sector have been based on electronics and software. Developments such as mobility services, autonomous driving or automated driving, networking, infotainment and e-mobility contribute significantly to the industry. With the number of software-controlled functions in an automatic car, its IT architecture is also changing towards central, virtual high-speed computers. Our goal is to provide students with the most the state-of-the-art technology that will enable them to work and innovate in the automotive domain and any other business domain available in the market today."

      "content": "The term “software engineering” was coined in 1968, during the NATO conference in Garmish. It was used in response to the problems associated with a software development that then still young IT sector was facing. Although more than 40 years have passed, the software development in many IT companies is still chaotic. Software is frequently delivered after the deadline, it costs much more than anticipated at the beginning, developers are often forced to work over-hours, and despite all these efforts, the software that is delivered does not meet customer needs and contains too many defects. The goal of Software Engineering as a discipline, is to deliver solutions that can be used to mitigate the problems associated with the software development by applying engineering methods to its development. Since 1998, Poznan University of Technology offers a M.Sc. program in Software Engineering. The curriculum aims at providing graduates with the necessary knowledge and skills to perform three important roles in IT projects: Project Manager – project management methodologies, risk management, planning (size and effort estimation of software development); Analyst – business process modeling, elicitation of functional and non-functional requirements for information systems, and preparation of acceptance tests; Architect, senior developer – object-oriented design, software architectures, real-time systems, and software testing."
